Rejistry
========

Pure Java parser for Windows Registry hive files.

Usage
-----
For the time being, see `src/test.java` and compare it with `./test.py`. But, as a user, you'll probably want to use
`RegistryHiveFile` with its `getRoot()` method, and then interact with the `RegistryValue` and `RegistryKey` classes.


Dependencies
------------
  - none, this is a pure Java parser

TODO
----
  - Make exceptions more specific
